Caltrain Visualization Challenge

This will be an amazing repository filled with groovy visualizations of Caltrain data.

## Questions
* Definition of a "good" station
* 

## Goals
* Visualize future ridership impacts
 * Per-person time saved under three projection scenarios
 * on average, or per station pair, or weighted by station pair ridership?
* Make the case for more development around the stations
* Benefits of changing land use
* Cost per new rider
* Redo service quality vs ridership potential graph for future timetables & land use projections


## Data we have
* Ridership by part of day for 2017
* Projected ridership through 2040 under three scenarios
* Land use for areas around the stations
* Schedule

## Data we need
